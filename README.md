# Usage

Supported models:

- Anthropic's Claude - configure API key with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.
- OpenAI's GPT3 and GPT4 - configure API key with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Quick start

- Make sure you have the most basic Playwright installation with `npm init playwright@latest`. See https://playwright.dev/docs/intro#installing-playwright for details.
- Install the CLI:

```
npm -g playwright-ai
```

- Obtrain the API key for the LLM model of your choice: [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com) or [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
- Execute the CLI from project directory:

```
playwright-ai --endpoint=https://example.com --model=claude --tests=1
```

- After the CLI is done, it will generate the tests into the Playwright test directory. As the tests generate, the CLI will have both passing and failing tests. The failing tests will have to be manually fixed by the user of the tool.

## Core Options
